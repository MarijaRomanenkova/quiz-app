/**
 * Topic slice for managing quiz topics and topic selection
 * 
 * This slice handles topic data management and organization including:
 * - Topic data fetching and storage from backend
 * - Topic selection state management
 * - Topic sorting and organization by category and order
 * - Integration with progress and questions slices
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Automatic topic data fetching with authentication support
 * - Topic selection persistence and state management
 * - Topic sorting by topicOrder, categoryId, and topicId
 * - Integration with progress slice for completed topic tracking
 * - Error handling and loading states for topic operations
 * 
 * State management:
 * - topics: Array of available topics with metadata and ordering
 * - selectedTopicId: Currently selected topic for navigation
 * - isLoading: Loading state for topic operations
 * - error: Error state for failed operations
 * 
 * Selectors:
 * - selectSortedTopics: Returns topics sorted by topicOrder, categoryId, and topicId
